1. Write your "script" as if you would be speaking this aloud to an audience at a conference or pitching session.
2. Read it aloud, timing to run between 3-4 minutes.   
3. Post your written "script" of the briefing here, as if you were delivering it in person or via Zoom.  Your deadline for this briefing is Friday evening by 11:59pm. 
Here's a run-down of suggested elements for your briefing.  Be selective.  The guiding rule is that it should only be about three to four minutes total in length:
- Introduce your client and describe the audience you want to reach.
- Define your purpose for this project. 
- State 2-3 Learning Objectives in a format such as this one: “As a result of hearing this presentation, the learner will be able to….”
-Mention at least 3 credible resources for added credibility.
-Attach or describe at least one visual that would be used with this audience. 
-Check to be sure you have scripted an effective opening and closing, which are the most memorable moments of a briefing.  What would stay in the listener's mind as the first and last thing you’d say?
